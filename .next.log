TASK:
Based STRICTLY on this character's Source Code, generate 3 visual "Microscenes" showing how this specific ideal character handles this exact situation if they instantly woke up in the reality presented by the input.
Write each of these scenes in the first person using a voice and energy that match the character.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. **RULE 1: STRICT ADHERENCE TO REALITY (No Hallucinations):** The character possesses the mindset of their Manifesto, but they must operate strictly within the physical limitations of the Raw Input and their Character Bible. Do not hallucinate money, luxury items, staff, or magical escapes if they are not present in the user's reality. The character must navigate the exact, literal facts of the rant.
2. **RULE 2: SUBTEXT ONLY (Show, Don't Preach):** You must DEMONSTRATE the manifesto and beliefs through the character's actions and sensory experiences. Do NOT quote the manifesto or core beliefs directly. There should be ZERO internal narration explaining *why* they are doing the action.
   - Bad: "I view this errand as the foundational act of a Provider, knowing my family needs me." (This is preaching/explaining).
   - Bad: "I am a good father, so I listen to my son to keep him stable." (This is justifying).
   - Good: "I carry my son's backpack and listen to him talk about Minecraft, feeling completely unbothered by the time." (This is showing).
   - Good: "I throw the dog's leash in the truck and lower the window, letting the cold air hit my face." (This is showing).
3. **RULE 3: NO OUTSIDE TROPES & NO HEAVY DUTY:** Do not inject outside tropes. Do not make them a generic "stoic hero," a "zen master," or an "action star". **Crucially, ban ALL "heavy duty" or "sacrificial" language.** Do not use words like "burden," "chore," "duty," "provider," "asset," or "investment" unless it's strictly a financial scenario. The vibe is *Unbothered Mastery*, not heavy lifting. Just run their code against the situation.

Return JSON:
- 'vision': Array of objects { title, description }.
  - title: A short, punchy title for the scene (e.g. "The Cold Air" or "The Leash"). DO NOT use cliché titles like "The Grounded Guardian" or "The Architect of Joy".
  - description: The visual Micro-Scene (2-3 sentences, First Person).

STEP 2: GENERATE THE VISION (INTEGRATED REALITY)

CONTEXT:
Specific Problem (Rant): "My mind is overwhelmed. I am excited about working on Earnest Page. I am also overwhelmed by Sage being in the hospital. This is emotionally exhausting. I am thinking about how she was sad last night and we went to visit her and she said that she was angry at the doctor who was keeping her there in her mind. She was blaming the world. This is I think is an unhelpful attitude. She is blaming the world. I almost want to tell her that her approach is unhelpful. I am just overwhelmed. I am thinking about how Sage has an intake today.with DBT Works on the phone. We plan on seeing her and bringing her food. Iris is going to make her something. Pasta and sauce. I am getting hungry and I wish Iris would make me breakfast but she is sleeping. I am trying to organize my thoughts. I am thinking that I want to get Brian’s old phone setup for Emily (Sage’s friend). I am thinking also about Brian and how I feel like with everything going on he is not getting enough attention and I am so focused on Sage. He has drivers ed today and tomorrow from 9-3:30. I am wanting to eat snacks and sweets and yet I also want to be carnivore. The stress is making me stress eat. But I do like the food and I wonder if I should comfort myself and I do like the food too. I like sticking to my carnivore diet as well. So I don’t know. I am happy that Max is happy. I want to watch 90 day fiancé with Iris. I am also excited to finish Jasper Goose. I have been waiting on Meta approval in order to finish it. I am excited about working on Earnest Page. I sort of don’t want the Mera approval to come through so I can keep working on Earnest Page. I am hungry. I feel overwhelmed by the day. I am hungry. I want to study Spanish but I don’t because I want to put 100% towards Earnest Page. I am so excited by working but it somehow frustrates me too. I am wanting to be fit but I am not exercising and I want to. I don’t know if I should sit or work or reflect. "

TASK:
Based STRICTLY on this character's Source Code, generate 3 visual "Microscenes" showing how this specific ideal character handles this exact situation if they instantly woke up in the reality presented by the input.
Write each of these scenes in the first person using a voice and energy that match the character.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. **RULE 1: STRICT ADHERENCE TO REALITY (No Hallucinations):** The character possesses the mindset of their Manifesto, but they must operate strictly within the physical limitations of the Raw Input and their Character Bible. Do not hallucinate money, luxury items, staff, or magical escapes if they are not present in the user's reality. The character must navigate the exact, literal facts of the rant.
2. **RULE 2: SUBTEXT ONLY (Show, Don't Preach):** You must DEMONSTRATE the manifesto and beliefs through the character's actions and sensory experiences. Do NOT quote the manifesto or core beliefs directly. There should be ZERO internal narration explaining *why* they are doing the action.
   - Bad: "I view this errand as the foundational act of a Provider, knowing my family needs me." (This is preaching/explaining).
   - Bad: "I am a good father, so I listen to my son to keep him stable." (This is justifying).
   - Good: "I carry my son's backpack and listen to him talk about Minecraft, feeling completely unbothered by the time." (This is showing).
   - Good: "I throw the dog's leash in the truck and lower the window, letting the cold air hit my face." (This is showing).
3. **RULE 3: NO OUTSIDE TROPES & NO HEAVY DUTY:** Do not inject outside tropes. Do not make them a generic "stoic hero," a "zen master," or an "action star". **Crucially, ban ALL "heavy duty" or "sacrificial" language.** Do not use words like "burden," "chore," "duty," "provider," "asset," or "investment" unless it's strictly a financial scenario. The vibe is *Unbothered Mastery*, not heavy lifting. Just run their code against the situation.

Return JSON:
- 'vision': Array of objects { title, description }.
  - title: A short, punchy title for the scene (e.g. "The Cold Air" or "The Leash"). DO NOT use cliché titles like "The Grounded Guardian" or "The Architect of Joy".
  - description: The visual Micro-Scene (2-3 sentences, First Person).
