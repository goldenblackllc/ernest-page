[PROJECT MANIFESTO: THE CHARACTER BIBLE APP]
Tech Stack: Next.js (App Router), Firebase App Hosting, Firestore, Firebase Auth, Tailwind CSS.
Core Concept: A social media app (Twitter/TikTok vibe) focused on Identity Shifting and CBT, gamified via an RPG metaphor.
The Model:
The Bible: A "Global Property" or "Config File" for the user. Contains their fundamental beliefs and rules.
The Logic:
Problems = Bugs in the Bible (belief clashes with reality).
Desires = Missing Features (gap between Current Character and Future Character).
Fix: Identify the Future/Ideal belief and overwrite the Current belief.
The Mechanics:
Edit: Manual updates to the Bible.
Debug: Using pain/failure to find incompatible rules.
Install: Importing traits from the "Future Self" to the "Present Self."
Execute: A specific formula for acting on these rules (TBD).

## THE PROTOCOL (Source Code)
See [Resolution Sequence](./PROJECT_MANIFESTO_RESOLUTION_SEQUENCE.md) for the active configuration.

### Core Transformations
- **Power:** I am powerless -> I am powerful
- **Identity:** I am a bad father -> I am a good father

### Synthesized Rules
1. **The Father Protocol**
   "Presence is the action. My stability is the asset."

2. **The Investor Mindset**
   "Volatility is not failure. I hold through the dip."
