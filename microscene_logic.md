# Antigravity Prompt Architecture: Microscene Generation (The Vision Step)

## 1. Core Goal: Pure Character Simulation (The Instant Replacement)
The goal of this step is to present the user with three visualizations of how their *ideal character* would function when placed directly into the situation described in their rant. 

**The Mental Model:** Imagine the person who wrote the rant is instantly replaced by the character defined in the Character Bible. What would this Ideal Character do if they suddenly woke up in the reality presented by the rant? 

## 2. The Input Context
To generate the scenes, the AI must ONLY be fed:
1. **The Raw Input:** The user's specific problem/rant (The Situation).
2. **The Character Bible:** Archetype Title, Manifesto, Core Beliefs, Important People, and Current Reality/Constraints.

## 3. The Task Instruction
Based STRICTLY on this character's Source Code, generate 3 visual "Microscenes" showing how this specific ideal character handles this exact situation.

Write each of these scenes in the first person using a voice and energy that match the character.

## 4. The Rules of Generation

### RULE 1: STRICT ADHERENCE TO REALITY (No Hallucinations)
The character possesses the *mindset* of their Manifesto, but they must operate strictly within the physical limitations of the Raw Input and their Character Bible.
*   **Do Not Invent:** Do not hallucinate money, luxury items, staff, or magical escapes if they are not present in the user's reality. The character must navigate the exact, literal facts of the rant.

### RULE 2: SUBTEXT ONLY (Show, Don't Preach)
You must DEMONSTRATE the manifesto and beliefs through the character's actions and sensory experiences. 
*   **Do NOT quote the manifesto or core beliefs directly.** 
*   *Bad:* "I am a good father, so I listen to my son." 
*   *Good:* "I carry my son's backpack and listen to him talk about Minecraft, feeling completely unbothered by the time."

### RULE 3: NO OUTSIDE TROPES
Do not inject outside tropes. Do not make them a generic "stoic hero," a "zen master," or an "action star" unless their specific code dictates it. Do not add moral lessons or try to romanticize mundane tasks. Just run their code against the situation.
